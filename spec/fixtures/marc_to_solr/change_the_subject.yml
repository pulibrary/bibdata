Gabrielle Foreman, et al. “Writing about Slavery/Teaching About Slavery: This Might Help.” Capitalization of \"Indigenous\" appears to be preferred by those from Indigenous communities, for example see https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/writing/inclusive-antiracist-writing/bipoc and https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/indigenous-peoples-terminology-guidelines-for-usage.  As this is a broad term, when possible, one should include the name of the community(ies) or nation(s) of the people in the record. "

When possible, it is respectful to also include the name of the community(ies) or nation(s) of the people in the record, for example \"Chumash,\" \"Tonkawa,\" \"Rapa Nui,\" \"Huetar.\""
