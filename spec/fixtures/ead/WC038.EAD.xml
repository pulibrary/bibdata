                        <p>The slides in this series appear to have once been stored in an original order that has since been lost. Fraser labeled the slides
                            into series and numbers, some of which appear to match an order that is no longer discernable. Many slides have titles, dates and
                            numbers, but the original order has not survived. The photographs correspond with Fraser's trips to the western United States in
                            1915, 1916, 1918, and 1919, all of which are documented in diaries in the collection. At least one slide taken in Zion National Park
                            is dated 1921 and another slide in Utah dated to 1923.</p>
                        <p>Topics include geology, local Native Americans (Navajos), landbridges, cliff dwellings, pueblos, and landscapes. Two images of a
                            rodeo in Payson, Utah are present. Locations include Canyon de Chelly, Monument Valley, Mesa Verde, Acoma Pueblo, Zion, Oraibi Mesa,
                            Bryce Canyon, Meteor Crater, Grand Canyon, Bright Angel canyon, Temple Creek Canyon, landscapes in New Mexico, Arizona, and
                            Utah.</p>
                        <p>There is a high concentration of images of cliff dwellings and pueblos in box 10.</p>
