         <abstract>The Garrett-Gates Collection contains approximately 250 Mesoamerican manuscripts,
            chiefly written in Latin script. Maya languages are well represented, predominantly
            Yucatec and K'iche', and to a lesser degree Kaqchikel, Tzutuhil, Tzeltal, Pokoman,
            Chorti, Cholti, and K'eq'chi.</abstract>

         <p>William E. (Edmond) Gates (1863-1940), a printer by trade and a Maya linguist,
            archaeologist, and collector by avocation. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia on Dec. 8,
            1863 and obtained an A.B. degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1886, where among
            other subjects he studied languages of the Near East and Asia. As a self-created
            Mayanist, Gates became a scholar-collector who dedicated the remainder of his life to
            the acquisition, study, and publication of manuscripts relating to the cultural region
            of Mesoamerica (Middle America), an area extending roughly from modern-day central
            Mexico to El Salvador and Guatemala. Gates collected thousands of Maya and Mexicana
            manuscripts from around the world, from which he printed hundreds of translations,
            facsimiles, and transcriptions.</p>
         <p>Gates developed a particular interest in the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphs, which
            covered ruins throughout Guatemala and Yucatan, and the two Maya languages Ki'che' and
            Yucatec. The ancient Maya civilization, developed in the 2nd millennium BC, was the only
            Pre-Columbian civilization in the western hemisphere to create a unique writing system,
            thus providing the Maya with the means to create a written history. Gates dedicated some
            thirty years of his life toward the understanding of this system and, because of his
            printing interests, the design and development of a font for Maya hieroglyphic type.
            Between the years 1914 and 1930, Gates collected as many manuscripts, vocabularies,
            texts, doctrines, and other artifacts from the earliest years of Spanish occupation as
            possible. Throughout the years he would spend thousands of dollars in the pursuit of
            manuscripts, believing it was within these original manuscript sources that he would
            find the answers to his linguistic questions concerning the decipherment of the Maya
            hieroglyphs.</p>
         <p>In 1920, Gates established the Maya Society in Auburn Hill, near Charlottesville,
            Virginia, which had the sole purpose of the collection and dissemination of information
            on Maya languages and culture. Under the auspices of the Society, he published over
            twenty volumes of transcriptions and translations, including dictionaries, calendars,
            medico-botanical texts, and historical texts concerning the Spanish conquest. In 1930,
            as a means to recover from his ongoing financial difficulty, Gates reluctantly sold a
            portion of his manuscript "collextion" to Robert Garrett (1875-1961), a fellow resident
            of Baltimore, Princeton Class of 1897, Olympic athlete, investment banker, Princeton
            Charter Trustee, and collector. William Gates died on Apr. 24, 1940 in Baltimore,
            Maryland, leaving incomplete his research on the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphs.
            In his lifetime he collected thousands of manuscripts and printed materials in the
            indigenous languages of Middle America, which would eventually be dispersed among
            several libraries throughout the United States.</p>

            <p>The Garrett-Gates Collection (C0744) contains approximately 250 Mesoamerican
               manuscripts, chiefly written in Latin script. Maya languages are well represented,
               predominantly Yucatec and K'iche', and to a lesser degree Kaqchikel, Tzutuhil,
               Tzeltal, Pokoman, Chorti, Cholti, and K'eq'chi. In addition, there are several
               manuscripts in other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, Zoque, and Otomì.
               Many of the manuscripts also contain Spanish and/or Latin devotional, liturgical, and
               other texts. The collection consists of original manuscripts, documents, and
               transcriptions of ancient hieroglyphic texts, dating from the time of the Spanish
               conquest to the early 20th century, and includes ritual incantations, Chilam Balam
               books, Caste War letters, Spanish translations of Christian doctrinal works,
               manuscript dictionaries of the native languages, histories, autograph letters, land
               documents, maps, and confraternity records. William Gates acquired these manuscripts
               between 1910 and 1930 for the purpose of linguistic study. The manuscripts offer
               copies of texts in indigenous languages and provide evidence of the history and
               evolution of those languages under the influence of Spanish civilization during the
               period of Western contact with the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The materials
               also illustrate how the Spanish culture affected all aspects of life in New Spain,
               from the practice of religion to transfer of lands from the natives to the Spanish
               colonists.</p>

            <p>This collection forms part of the Robert Garrett Collection (C0744) and is organized
               by language. Many of the manuscripts also include Spanish and/or Latin. There are
               gaps in the numbering sequence, which were intentionally created by William Gates to
               account for any possible growth within sections. For example, Gates stopped at no.
               76, marking the end of the Yucatec section, then began the K'iche' section with no.
               101. He left a gap after no. 196 because he had hopes of locating manuscripts, which
               he would later incorporate (as he did with nos. 201-218). According to Gates, numbers
               3, 196-200, 257, 259, 260-261, and 263 were removed from the collection.</p>
