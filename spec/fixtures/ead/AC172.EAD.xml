         <p>The Princeton University Women's Organization (PUWO) was formed in the winter of 1972 to provide a body through which the women of Princeton University community (employees and students) could monitor and discuss issues related to employment and student life. The original structure of the organization called for a series of task forces working on specific issues, a coordinating committee composed of representatives from each task force, and monthly general meetings to inform the membership of task force and committee activities and to vote on questions of policy. The organization also ran panel discussions and other programs on women's issues.</p>
