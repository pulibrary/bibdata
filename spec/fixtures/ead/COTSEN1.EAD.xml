                            <p>December 1842, New York; from Albert Chrystie's brother J. W.
                                Chrystie. A long eulogistic letter about Mary Chrystie (Albert
                                Chystie's daughter), written as "a tribute of affection to a Brother
                                dearly beloved, and to the memory of his daughter. . .". J. W.
                                Chrystie was Mary's teacher for 3 years. Included with the letter is
                                an addressed cover sheet with the following pencil-written note on
                                verso: "Dear Brother, if you think it of sufficient importance I
                                will write one a fairer copy of the enclosed. Mr J. C."</p>

                                New York. Mary writes to her brother to tell him of family plans and
                                doings while he is away at school; she closes with instructions to
                                "direct your thoughts to God", for their mother and father are
                                uneasy about his studies.</p>

                                Princeton. 2 letters on one sheet (the first letter by Mary, the
                                second letter by her Mother, Frances). Mary regales her brother with
                                a description of her daily life and apologizes for not getting him a
                                Christmas gift because "Princeton is a poor place and mama is loath
                                to part with her money". Frances entreats Willie to send them more
                                letters and reminds him to show his appreciation of a Mr. Dardan's
                                generosity (he gave Willie a copy of Robinson Crusoe).</p>

                            <p>July 25 (no year), Lebanonville; 2 letters (1 from Mary and 1 from
                                her mother, Frances). Mary Chrystie writes to her maternal great
                                aunt, Maria Montgomery, about her outdoor activities at
                                Lebanonville, including a session of horseback riding that made her
                                "not the least afraid", but nevertheless left her sore: ". . . my
                                bones acked (sic) so badly, at first I thought it was the
                                rheumatism". Frances tells her Aunt, Maria Montgomery, about the
                                pleasant time she and the family are having in the country,
                                expresses concern over Mary's heatlh, and laments that the mail in
                                Lebanonville is not "well regulated". Mary Chrystie's green wax
                                "Mary" seal is attached. Year supplied by inference, the only year
                                provided from Mary's time in Lebanonville is a letter to Anne

                                Rochelle; New York. Mary tells Maria, her maternal great aunt, about
                                the fun she is having while not at her lessons: she describes a pair
                                of swimming dogs and the near death of one of them and she explains
                                how to play a jump-rope game called "fox and geese". Mary expresses
                                homesickness and asks for supplies such as towels, a wash rag, a box
                                of wafers, and a bottle of comphire.</p>

                                18 at New Rochelle, New York. A very busy letter in which Mary
                                complains about Madame, explains in detail her attempt to make her
                                mother a muslin collar, describes how a Mr. Lorillard, the owner of
                                a snuff factory, has determined that Mary will be an old maid
                                because she did not sneeze while taking a pinch of snuff, mentions
                                that she has been "poisened (sic) pretty badly" but is coping with
                                the help of flaxseed tea, states that she has lost the brooch her
                                brother gave her, and notes that she is "distressingly in want of
                                funds . . . nothing less than dollars will do . . .". Dates supplied

                                the letter itself), Pelham Priory. A short letter in which Mary
                                mentions that she has been suffering from a cough and sore throat,
                                complains that two of her friends have not written her, and
                                excitedly relates how she has marked the days until she is able to
                                give "little Mary Wilkes" a white worsted cap that she will knit in
                                the future on "the 14th of October 1840". (The sequence of marked

                            <p>January 15, 1836; postmarked January 16 at Princeton. 2 letters (1
                                from Mary and 1 from her mother, Frances). Various news from Mary,
                                including an account of how she is now "working for poor children"
                                by knitting and making caps. Frances describes Mary's recent bouts
                                with stomach flu, fever, and respiratory problems; she also
                                unfavorably compares Princeton to New York, saying of Princeton that
                                it is "a bad place to bring up children".</p>

                                letter from Mary and one letter from Frances. Mary describes her

                                the time she's spent in Philadelphia.</p>

                                and tells her aunt Mary that she is sending along two baskets,

                            <p>December 1832 (dated from a pencil written statement by Frances
                                Chrystie, Mary's mother, on verso of letter), Fishkill Landing. Mary
                                tells her "dear aunt Tildy" about her dog Frisk, his other canine
                                friends, and another local dog that goes to church every Sunday and
                                "sets up in the pew behind us and behaves like a gentleman". She
                                asks Matilda to send down her lap dog and her cat. Since Mary is
                                writing on a Sunday, she decides to transcribe a hymn, "Worth of the
                                Bible". Mary mentions that she has "a very great secret which will
                                surprise you very much", but she does not reveal it. Includes a
                                pencil sketch of a tree on the verso.</p>

                                one from Mary's mother Frances). Although the letter is dated
                                December 19, Mary states that it is Christmas Day. She goes on to
                                enumerate the presents that she has recieved: "battledoor &amp;
                                shuttlecock - a sugar dog - a cornucopia full of sugar plums - a
                                beautiful book full of pictures - and wooden cart made by her
                                brother Willie". Frances expresses a great deal of unhappiness and
                                weariness due largely, it seems, to the death of her grandmother:
                                "dear Grandmama - everyday I feel her loss - I cannot express to you
                                how interesting and how dear to me she was. Oh shall we ever meet
                                &amp; know &amp; love again?". Adding to her melancholy feelings are
                                the sickness of a good friend, Mrs. Schink, and Mary's continuing
                                respiratory ailments. Frances closes by warning Eliza to regulate
                                her affections for her pet (child?), Robert.</p>

                                from Mary's brother William, and 1 from Mary's mother Frances). A
                                short note from Mary and a short note from William. Frances

                                studies with her mother and father: "[Mary] has certainly in the

                                now pronounce her a child of truth". Frances also expresses her
                                regrets that Eliza has been surrounded by the sickness and death
                                brought about by an outbreak of scarlet fever (in Newburgh?).

                                with salution "Dear Rosa" (a pet name, perhaps). At the time of this
                                writing, Mary was studying in New York with a Miss Campbell. In this
                                letter Mary writes to her Rhoda, a school friend from her time spent
                                at Pelham Priory, instructing Rhoda to say hello to all of her other
                                friends at Pelham Priory.</p>

                                saying "Favoured by Mr. Jay Bolton". Mary requests that her friend
                                Rhoda come visit her, if for no other reason than that she will then
                                be familiar with Mary's surroundings and local friends; this, then,
                                will allow Mary to write letters that will be both longer and of

                            <p>Wednesday, August (circa 1840), Pelham Priory; postmarked August 27
                                at New Rochelle, New York. This letter appears to have been written
                                after Mary wrote her August 17 letter to her great aunt Maria
                                Montgomery (see series: Letters to Maria Montgomery, item 4). Mary
                                Chrystie writes to her mother Frances Chrystie that she has been
                                afflicted with flea bites (125 separate bites, by her own count),
                                but that she is "growing used to them". She mentions that the
                                "poison" she had referred to in her letter to Maria Montgomery, "is
                                going away". She decribes her regimen of bathing in salt water and
                                her decision to no longer use flaxseed to treat her ailments. She
                                also mentions (as she had to Maria Montgomery) the loss of the
                                brooch her brother gave her.</p>

                                Rochelle, New York. Mary Chrystie again writes to her mother Frances
                                Chrystie about her flea problem and notes that her "poison" is
                                almost gone and "does not trouble me at all now, and only looks very
                                ugly". Mary complains that her music teacher "is so hatefully cross
                                that I tremble when she calls me to take my lesson" and mentions
                                that her throat is "pretty well" but that she "wheeze[s] when the
                                weather is at all damp".</p>

                                Cromwell's side; she closes the letter with a compliment she
                                received from her teacher: "[Miss Bolton] says that she never knew

                                hand at top of first page; with her time at Pelham Priory coming to
                                an end, Mary writes her mother to tell her that she still suffers
                                from a cough, headaches, and a sore throat and asks if she can come
                                home as soon as possible; most interesting are Mary's own lesson
                                plans for her winter at home: she has 2 hours set aside with her
                                father (bookeeping, sums, writing, spelling, and French), time spent
                                studying history, notably "Ramsay's United States" (David Ramsay's
                                History of the United States, unfinished at his death in 1815, but
                                completed by his brother-in-law, S. Stanhope Smith; Ramsay was a
                                graduate of Princeton in 1765) with her mother, and supplemental
                                learning with a number of composition books, reading a dictionary,
                                and memorizing French phrases and verbs, with, perhaps, some
                                readings from "Banicastle's astronomy" (John Bonnycastle's
                                Introduction to Astronomy, London, 1796), with music and painting
                                filling in the rest of her time.</p>

                            <p>Monday (no date), postmarked January (?) 16 at Fishkill Landing; from
                                Mary Chrystie's mother, Frances Chrystie. A rather melancholy letter
                                full of thoughts of loss and death as Mrs. Chrystie describes Mary's
                                continuing ill-health (from a present case of "whooping cough," Mrs.
                                Chrystie says); her anxiety for Mary and the severity of Mary's
                                illness are testified by the following lines: "Sometimes I have a
                                glimpse of things as they are in this world and then I can
                                undeservedly give her up to God and say Thy will be done--but too
                                often I cannot even bear to think of parting with her--she is a dear
                                little creature and tho' full of faults I am sure if she is spared
                                she will be a good woman..."; Mrs. Chrystie then goes on to describe
                                the failing health of a number of other women in the
                                neighborhood.</p>

                            <p>July 10, 1841, Lebanon; 2 letters (1 from Mary Chrystie and 1 from
                                her mother, Frances Chrystie); with substantial remains of a dark
                                green wax seal (with "Mary" still legible). Mary describes her time
                                in the country, with particular attention paid to the dogs, kittens,
                                and birds around the farm at which she is staying; Mary also
                                excitedly relates that she has "been made the confidant in love
                                affairs, an office which I like very much, as I have love letters
                                read to me" (the love letters are from a Mr. Beals and are directed
                                to Mary's friend(?) Louisa). Frances Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's
                                mother, complains that she has not had a letter in some time, and
                                mentions that Mary is gaining strength and that Albert Chrystie,
                                Frances' husband, is suffering from some sort of "dispeptic feeling
                                which occasions an irregularity of his pulse."</p>

                                spends the rest of the letter describing the health and affairs of

                            <p>No date; postmarked February 17 from New York; from Frances Chrystie,
                                Mary Chrystie's mother. Written to the side of the address block is
                                a note in a different ink: "Letters in which my child is
                                mentioned"--evidence of Frances Chrystie's attempt to gather
                                materials by and concerning Mary after her death; Frances Chrystie
                                writes about her great pleasure at wintering in the city and states
                                that she is so content that "no change for me can be for the
                                better"; Willie (William, Mary Chrystie's brother) and Mary are now
                                studying under a new teacher who is much loved and respected by his
                                pupils; Mary wheezes on occasion, but her health has largely been
                                sound.</p>

                                Mary Chrystie. Mary apologizes for not having written sooner, but
                                she has a good excuse: "I have been obliged to keep my room (and
                                part of the time my bed) for nearly three weeks with an inflammation
                                of my lungs"; she describes in detail her new dog--which she has
                                named Rhoda in honor of her friend ("I hope you are able to
                                appreciate the honour conferred on you..."); she explains that due
                                to her illness she will not attend school "for some time"; Mary
                                copies a long riddle for Rhoda to solve. A hole in the second leaf

                            <p>Dated August 19 (no year, but circa 1840), Pelham Priory; Postmarked
                                August 22 at New Rochelle, New York; from Mary Chrystie. Labeled
                                "(No 2)" in an unknown hand on top of first page. A very newsy and
                                interesting letter in which Mary describes her life and surroundings
                                at Pelham Priory; she is involved in "a little scoiety...to work for
                                the poor in the neighborhood" (sewing for poor families) and it is
                                while delivering some of the clothes they have prepared that Mary,
                                in an attempt to skirt around a swampy area, falls off a fence into
                                some bushes and brambles concealing "poison vines"--the cause of
                                Mary's "poisoning" mentioned in a letter to her great aunt and to
                                her mother (see Letters to Maria Montgomery 4 and Miscellaneous
                                Letters 1 and 2). Mary describes numerous Revolutionary War sites in
                                the area, including an immense rock in the forest used by Americans
                                to grind corn, the "haunted oak" where "several men were
                                hung...during the war," and small spring where two Americans were
                                shot by the British while having a drink; she also describes an
                                interesting Irishman ("quite an original character"), a workman at
                                the Priory; and she describes a "post office" that she and her
                                friends have established at which they deposit letters they write to
                                each other under fictitious names (Mary is Lady Albertine Collona of
                                Geneva, Switzerland, but she is considering changing her name to
                                Biddy O'Brian of Cork, Ireland); Mary also transcribes a letter she
                                has received from the "Duke of Wellington," written by Ada
                                Bolton.</p>

                            <p>Dated July 6, 1841, Lebanonville; from Mary Chrystie; with
                                substantial remains of dark green wax seal (with "Mary" still
                                legible). Mary writes from her uncle's (Albert Chrystie's brother's)
                                house in the country; she spends much of her time with her friend
                                Louisa, but their "amusements together have lately been very much
                                interrupted by [Louisa's] lover's (a Mr. Beals)" visits; Louisa's
                                engagement to Mr. Beals is back on after her sister, who, Mary says,
                                did not approve of the match, persuaded Louisa that she did not love
                                him enough; Mary describes other activities, such as driving with
                                her father, and expresses concern for her dog, who has been left at
                                home with the servants.</p>

                                from Mary Chrystie. A long letter written with crossed, overlapping
                                text throughout in which Mary describes her homesickness and a very
                                memorable picnic trip with all the other students at Pelham Priory
                                (Mary also includes a complete list of names of the people who went
                                on the picnic--31 people in all) to a nearby island; while sailing
                                to the island Mary's boat discovers a blind horse swimming away from
                                land and rescues it; a rush to be seated on an old, rotting bench
                                results of many of her classmates being deposited on the ground "in
                                a number of very interesting positions"; Mary also describes a
                                singing game played between the two boat-loads of students, and
                                transcribes the text of a sung prayer used that day at lunch. Dates

                                pounds; she mentions that she has been "quite sick" but is now well;
                                and she scolds Anne for not writing more often: "I have had twenty

                                "Written.Feb.7.1836." Entitled "Prayer to God"; Mary prays for an

                                Redeemer I now give myself to thee in my presence. I will solemnly
                                give my word that I will henceforth deem thy word as sacred and

                            <p>No date, but after Mary Chrystie's death in 1842. A note written by
                                Mary's mother, Frances Chrystie, explaining how she found the above
                                described prayer ("Prayer of Dedication") written by Mary; Frances
                                Chrystie found the prayer in 1836 but did not tell Mary that she had
                                discovered it until "a few days before she left us." Mrs. Chrystie
                                goes on to relate how she told Mary it was apparent that she had
                                dedicated herself to God at a very young age. She then explains that
                                Mary responded by saying "I was very wicked." Mrs. Chrystie recalls
                                that at the time the prayer was written Mary was constantly
                                questioning how her mother knew whether everything the Bible said
                                was true. Mrs. Chrystie concludes: "I think when I mentioned the
                                enclosed paper it awakened regret at her sceptical feelings that
                                winter and the way in which she often expressed them to me."</p>

                            <p>The first poem, copied by Mary Chrystie(?) through stanza 9, is "The
                                Crucifixion," originally published in The Amulet for 1830, and later
                                reprinted in religious periodicals including The Evangelical
                                Magazine and Missionary Chronicle, Volume 7. The scond poem, verso,
                                appears to be an original composition by Mary Chrystie. It is an
                                unfinished, untitled poem of two 4-line stanzas, with third stanza
                                marker present but no text. It contrasts the happiness of children
                                at "mery" (sic) harvest time ("Very joyous is their joys") with the
                                feelings of "a little child thats sick" who wishes to "run through
                                snow and the rain."</p>

                            <p>An aborted attempt(?) by Mary Chrystie to start a journal. The text,
                                headed with the word "Journal," reads in full: "I am now going to
                                write a journal of myself once or twice I indulged a passion which
                                caused me to say I wished my mother was dead. Mr Hyer came to see us
                                and talk to me I can never forget what he said to me he said I ought
                                to give myself to God and I had allready done it I have". On the
                                final page Frances Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's mother, has written:
                                "This journal was begun before we left(?) Fishkill consequently
                                before she was eight years old--it was meant for no eye but her

                            <p>A story about five children raised in a "very wicked" household. Four
                                of them are wicked, but the fifth child, Jane, is saved when she
                                learns about God in school. She quotes from the hymn "Little
                                Children, love each other." In Chapter II, Jane's mother send for a
                                man to kill her own children; instead, the man adopts the children
                                into his own happy family, "religious people" who "went to church
                                every Sabbath." At the end, their wicked mother, now "blind and
                                feeble" comes to the children's adopted home but faints "at the
                                sound of their voices." Note in Mary's mother's, (Frances
                                Chrystie's) hand at the bottom of the page reads "Story for the box.
                                Written Between 8 &amp; 9 years of age."</p>

                            <p>The first four pages of a story by Mary Chrystie entitled "The
                                Hermit's Tale." The epigraph is a quotation from "The Minstrel; or,
                                The Progress of Genius," by James Beattie, who also wrote a poem
                                called "The Hermit" (1771). The plot of this fragment seems to have
                                been influenced by both poems. In the story, a young traveler on a
                                hiking trip hears about a hermit who is supposed to live in the
                                passes of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It contains some lyrical
                                descriptions of landscape: "The night was dark for the moon had not
                                risen but ten thousand times ten thousand little stars were peeping
                                from thier (sic) azure home..." The traveler finds the hermit, "an
                                old man with beard hanging to his waist and long unshorn locks," and
                                tells the hermit about his life. But the story breaks off just as
                                the Hermit begins to tell his own story, a didactic tale "to show
                                how sorrow in age springs from pleasure in youth." The location of
                                the rest of the story is unknown.</p>

                            <p>December 6, 1816, Paris; from N. Gallatin, written to her sister
                                Catherine Few, Mary's maternal grandmother, but addressed to
                                Catherine Few's husband Colonel William Few (father of Frances
                                Chrystie, and Mary's grandfather). Gallatin describes English
                                preaching "in the Episcopal Form": "They pray for King George, that
                                he may overcome all of his enemies, that seems so strange to me. But
                                the congreagation are entirely made up of English, nevertheless you
                                may be sure an American cannot relish hearing, or at least cannot
                                unite in offering up such prayers, although they may be very good
                                Christians. The sermons are pretty good but not delivered with much
                                solemnity."; also of note in the letter is a mention of a Frances
                                Gallatin leaving a boarding school after having "not made much
                                progress in speaking French"; and also a mention of an Albert who is
                                visiting Geneva: "He appears to be very happy with his relations and
                                they are fond of him. He says he thinks he must marry there, only
                                they will introduce him to none but old ladies and he reproaches
                                them for it"; also, an interesting postscript: "Vanbrugh Livingston
                                has got quite well and is grown monstrous fat. We see him
                                often."</p>

                                Chrystie, Mary's brother, or a different William altogether. A brief

                                New York; from Albert Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's father, to "Smith."
                                A very interesting letter in which Mr. Chrystie writes to his friend
                                Smith who appears to be a member of (or in some way affiliated) with
                                the British Parliament; Mr. Chrystie discusses the relative merits
                                of those in politics and whether their elevation above "us plebians"
                                is just; he reviews the state of politics in Washington and "the
                                high sense we entertain now adays of our own importance as a
                                nation"; he describes his studies, mentions mutual friends, requests
                                a copy of a book ("a handsome edition of Lavater(?)") and describes
                                some orations he has recently seen.</p>

                                1812 and the fighting going on in Europe in 1814, and an optimistic
                                hope for its conclusion: "I am more inclined than ever to think we

                                maternal great-grandfather, and father of Catherine Nicholson Few,
                                Mary's maternal grandmother) to his daughter Maria. Maria is perhaps
                                Mary's great aunt Maria Montgomery. A short letter in which Mr.
                                Nicholson passes on news concerning the family and expresses
                                disappointment that Maria will not be able to be with him as soon as
                                originally expected; Mr. Nicholson patiently accepts the delay:
                                "...yet we submit knowing it is our duty to do so, perhaps as the
                                Alarm of War has taken another turn.'</p>

                                aunt. Frances Chrystie writes to her sister who, ten days
                                previously, set off on a journey by sea to Savannah, Georgia; due to
                                strong winds and storms, she expresses no small amount of anxiety
                                over her sister's well-being at sea; she mentions Mary's facility
                                with writing: "...teaching Mary is the greatest possible amusement
                                to me...as to writing I never saw any one learn so fast. She writes
                                whole sentences on the slate without a copy..."</p>

                            <p>March 10, 1843, Oak Hills; from J.W. Nicholson, Mary Chrystie's great
                                uncle, to his sisters Catherine Few (Mary's grandmother) and Maria
                                Montgomery (Mary's great aunt). Mr. Nicholson writes to express his
                                condolences over their recent loss (of Mary?); he then goes on to
                                mention the dire illness of his own daughter (named Frances) who
                                suffers from consumption; he mentions his own health problems and
                                complains of being "very weak," a condition he says might be related
                                to his total abstinence from wine and spirits since joining the
                                Temperance Society some months previously--he does, however,
                                acknowledge that his debility could stem from old age.</p>

                            <p>June 15, 1842, Geneva (date and place taken from note from Frances
                                Chrystie; year taken from postmark); postmarked July 1, 1842 (no
                                place); 2 letters to Catherine Few (Mary Chrystie's grandmother),
                                one from William Few Chrystie (Mary's brother) and one from Frances
                                Few Chrystie (Mary's mother). William consciously avoids writing
                                about the death of his sister Mary and the illness of his father and
                                instead describes his travels for his grandmother in order to
                                "afford...some passing amusement"; Willie has thoroughly enjoyed
                                Italy, preferring Rome should he stay to study, but liking Florence
                                better "for amusement and excitement of every kind"; Venice,
                                "although very striking at first sight soon becomes too monotonous,
                                and the motion of the gondolas although by way of variety still soon
                                becomes exceedingly tiresome"; also described in brief are Milan, a
                                sailing trip around Lake Como, a day spent rowing on Lake Maggiore,
                                an ascent of Simplon Mountain, a visit to Chillon castle and its
                                dungeons (made famous by Lord Byron's "The Prisoner of
                                Chillon"--while there the Chrysties were disappointed in their
                                attempt to introduce themselves to the Countess of Sellon; Frances
                                Chrystie adds a note stating that Albert has recovered from the
                                illness he suffered in Milan, thereby saving her from being "doubly
                                bereaved"; she refers to Mary's death: "...all is not taken from me
                                tho' that which gave me enjoyment in all (sic) is"; she also
                                mentions that they will be returning home via London, and
                                cryptically adds that they may be detained there: "We cannot
                                entirely control our own movements. As soon as we get to L I will
                                let you know why, at present I am bound to secrecy"; she closes by
                                telling her mother that she had a dream in which her Aunt Lizzy(?)
                                appeared to her and told her "All was well," (see also below, item 3
                                of the "Post-mortem items" series). Frances Chrystie concludes with
                                the following words: "...&amp; so it is dear Mother if Jesus died
                                for us all is well--well for time and well for eternity."</p>

                                Chrystie's aunt, to Frances Few Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's mother. A

                                surface--in which Mary Few comforts her sister over the death of
                                Mary Chrystie; in spite of her mind being "obtuse to all that is
                                spiritual," Mary writes to her sister to tell her of various
                                religious sentiments--and pre-sentiments--that she has had; she
                                refers to "how tenderly little Albert Gallatin and she [Mary
                                Chrystie] loved each other in their childhood" and mentions that
                                Albert Gallatin was affected "most keenly" by the news of her death
                                and "was in great danger of falling into his Catholic supersitions"
                                but Mary's "sweet example" might "lure him into the path of truth
                                and holiness"; she refers to a request made by Mary: "Love and
                                remember me, but do not weep for me"; and she comforts Frances
                                Chrystie, reminding her that Mary "chose a better portion even in
                                the full enjoyment of all that this world could bestow--You
                                dedicated her to God--you brought her up for him--He has claimed the

                                time (with the birth of William Few Chrystie); Mary is happy that
                                the infant is a boy, "for this world is certainly particularly

                                college"--Yale, presumably; Frances also asks her sister about a

                                an elegant and gentell man should be found in this republican
                                country" (this sighting may date the letter to before 1821 and van
                                Buren's election to the U.S. Senate).</p>

                            <p>November 1828; from Frances Few Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's mother, to
                                Eliza Durham, Mary Chrystie's aunt. Mention of Albert Chrystie, Mary
                                Chrystie's father, visiting a prospective school for Willie and Mary
                                (a school on Fulton St.); also mentions a Mr. Stewart who will be
                                serving as chaplain on a "publick vessel" which will take him to the
                                Sandwich Islands; Frances enquires as to how Eliza's school is
                                coming along and whether or not she is making any money with it; a
                                wedding was held at the Chrystie house (the wedding of George
                                Chrystie and Frances Gallatin); Frances Chrystie also mentions that
                                Willie has a "boy doll" that he plays with, and that he informed her
                                that he was going to be a soldier, to which her response was: "I
                                [told him] I thought it would be better to teach him how to be good
                                than to teach him to fight"; little Mary Chrystie's response to
                                Willie's declaration was "Oh Willie you may look at the soldiers but
                                you must worship God"; also, when asked if she has a message for her
                                aunt, Mary says "she has love for you but she won't send it she will
                                give it to you when she goes to Newburgh."</p>

                            in 1842. Notes from Mary Chrystie's mother, Frances Few Chrystie, and
                            aunt, Mary Few, describing their grief over Mary's death and
                            memorializing her life. The most significant item (item 2) is a
                            hagiography of Mary Chrystie, written by her mother and father. The
                            document is a brief but detailed biography, including many anecdotes
                            that portray Mary as gentle, loving, and pious throughout her short
                            life. The hagiography has been transcribed and a typescript is available
                            in Eric Johnson's notes at Seeley Mudd Manuscript Library.</p>

                                Reverend F.P. Tappan. A short note which accompanied a variety of
                                biographical materials about Mary Chrystie: "I send the materials
                                for the biographical sketch in which you have so kindly interested

                            <p>No date; at least partially written by Albert Chrystie, Mary
                                Chrystie's father, and perhaps by her mother Frances Few Chrystie. A
                                hagiography of Mary Chrystie. 9 written pages describing in some
                                detail Mary Chrystie's spiritual devotion, character, qualities, and
                                latent intelligence, as well as her loving relationship with her
                                family--especially her extremely close relationship with her mother,
                                who was described by Mary as being her "oldest sister. You never
                                command me, but you tell me what is best, and you deny me nothing,
                                without convincing me it is best I should do without it"; Mary is
                                descibed as having begun walking "at less than 10 months old"; at 19
                                months she was freely talking; at 3 years of age she "could repeat
                                in her own language the substance" of Watt's First Catechism for
                                Children; at age 4 she read very well; and "Religious truth made a
                                sensible impression," so much so that she prayed to be forgiven "for
                                every sin that she thought she had been committing"; she did not
                                associate much with friends or servants, choosing instead to invest
                                her time in her immediate family; she was a "conspicuous"
                                participant in her father's Sunday evening family Bible class (which
                                the domestics were also invited to attend); while traveling to Italy
                                Mary told her mother, "I was never so happy in religion as I am
                                now--I never loved to pray so much," a statement that her mother
                                interpreted as a fortelling of Mary's death; her loving character is
                                testified to: "The last night of her life while resting her head on
                                her Father's bosom she said Father you promised me a watch when we
                                got to Geneva. Give it to Mother--do not forget"; very
                                interestingly, it is mentioned that when Mary was aged 5 or 6 "a
                                daily journal was begun to be kept of her misdeeds which was read to
                                her at night. Nothing pained her more than this journal, she would
                                often entreat that it might not be read &amp; sometimes refuse to
                                listen--but the effect was always salutary. The journal was not
                                always kept, but if any fault seemed to be gaining strength the
                                journal would be renewed for a week or month or longer. Some pages
                                of it have been found and will show her early character better than
                                any thing else (see above, item 9 of the "Prayers, Poems, and
                                Miscellaneous Notes" series for an example). Further anecdotes
                                detailing Mary's gentle and loving character can be found throughout

                            <p>November 24, 1843; A note by Frances Few Chrystie, Mary Chrystie's
                                mother, describing her grief at the death of her daughter the
                                previous Spring in Nice, her own apparent experience with the
                                "invisible world" and ministering angels in the aftermath of Mary's
                                death, and a dream she had on May 28th, in Bologna, in which she was
                                visited by her aunt Lizzy who told her, in response to Mrs.
                                Chrystie's query as to whether or not Lizzy had seen Mary, "All is
                                well" (See the "Miscellaneous Letters" series, item 9, for another
                                description of this dream). Mrs. Chrystie concludes: "I note these
                                things that I may keep in remembrance the goodness of the Lord to a
                                suffering creature so comforted &amp; so sustained. With dark events

                                setting the record straight about Mary's honesty: "in mentioning her
                                propensity to not speak the truth, I fear I may be misunderstood, it
                                showed itself only when she was a very little child..."; by the time
                                Mary was 7 or 8 "so strict was her veracity &amp; so entirely to be
                                depended upon" that Mary told the truth even to her own detriment;
                                also described is Mary's tolerant and forgiving nature; mention is
                                made of the Chrystie family's trip to Europe, and it seems that it
                                was in large part motivated by medical advice: "[Mary's] physicians
                                said that she ought not to return to America in two years"; Mary,
                                however, wanted to return home sooner rather than later in order to
                                prevent her mother from feeling herself "an exile" and so she might
                                grow up close to her friends so as not to differ from them or lose
                                any of their love.</p>

                                Reverend W. Tappan. A note with editorial corrections and
                                suggestions made by Mrs. Chrystie in regard to a memoir the Reverend
                                Tappan is writing about Mary; Mrs. Chrystie has made a couple of
                                specific changes: changing "Mother" to "parents" and effacing the
                                word "tyrannical" from the third page; she also urges the Reverend
                                to place more emphasis on the love between Mary and her father and
                                brother--if her brother William is not mentioned frequently in her
                                journals, it is because she only began keeping a diary after Willie
                                had left for school; Mrs. Chrystie supports the writing of this
                                "memoir" so "that the simple Christian experience of my blessed
                                child will lead some 'little ones' to Jesus that dear Saviour on
                                whom she [Mary] reposed in life and in death."</p>

                                geometry is described, as is her extreme enjoyment of reading and
                                writing--her enthusiam for recording her thoughts and desires
                                "induced a habit of careless writing &amp; careless spelling which
                                made her fall below the boarding-school standard--but it had also
                                given her a peculiar facility in expressing herself, while her love
                                of reading had furnished her with ideas which made her superior to

                            <p>Dated "Saturday Night 18th" (no year, but possibly 1842, the year of
                                Mary Chrystie's death); postmarked November 23 or 29 at Rhinebeck,
                                NY; from Mr. Gallatin to Mary Few, Mary Chrystie's aunt; a brief
                                note lamenting Mary Chrystie's death, along with a 22-line
                                eulogistic poem written by Mary Gallatin in honor of Mary Chrystie.
                                The poem urges faith in the face of grief, beginning: "In foreign
                                lands her sacred dust is laid/ By stranger lips her funeral rites
                                were said,/ Youth, Beauty, genius, fortune's favours given/ Unheeded
                                all, her eye was fixt on heaven..."</p>

                            <p>Dated August 14 (no year, but after Mary Chrystie's death in 1842),
                                written at Hell Gate; from T. F. Desmond(?) to Mary Few, Mary
                                Chrystie's aunt; a 40-line poem commemorating Mary Chrystie's death;
                                at the top of the first page is a note in pencil written in a
                                different hand: "Lines by Mrs. D." The poem compares Mary Chrystie's
                                short life to that of a rose: "But its quiet and star like beauty
                                told/ Too plainly on earth 'twas not meant to unfold." Now she rests
                                "in the sunlight of God's own eye;/ Where the leaf never droops and
                                the flowers never die."</p>

                            <p>Dated "Saturday 30th(?) January" (no year, but written during the
                                Civil War; possibly in 1864 when January 30 fell on a Saturday, if
                                the date is correct); from an aunt in Georgia(?) to Emily, possibly
                                the daughter of William Few Chrystie (Mary Chrystie's brother).
                                Recalls mutual acquaintances; mentions that "Mr. Chrystie had been
                                very sick"; a little over 4 lines of writing at the bottom of the
                                first page are nearly completely crossed out; at the top of page 2
                                the author expresses concern over a man whom the family has "not
                                hear a word from," stating "I have no doubt he was killed." Later on
                                p. 2 reference is made to one Frank Cocke(?), a member of the signal
                                corps who was killed in Savannah; "There is much sorrow in the land
                                and many of the most loved have been call (sic) away, and yet would
                                you believe the people are mainly gay..."; p. 4 lists other
                                acquaintances who have died, such as the minister's wife, as well as
                                a Mr. Henry who "has lost his mind"; closes with "My dear child I
                                shall make every effort to go North if my life is spared, if I
                                cannot obtain a Passport, I will try by the way of Memphis or

                            and written in pen in the hand of Mary Chrystie's mother, Frances Few
                            Chrystie: "Mary Chrystie 12 years old"; inside of rear wrapper covered
                            with small drawings and doodles and the words "William Few Chrystie has
                            this book or in French dis livre" written in the hand of Mary's brother,
                            William Few Chrystie. First 4 sewn in pages: letter from Mary Chrystie
                            in Saratoga Springs to her brother, Willy, in New York City; final 8
                            sewn in pages: journal entries beginning July 12, 1837 (written while in
                            Saratoga Springs) in which Mary describes family activities in Saratoga.
                            Included in the sewn in pages is an entry from July 16, 1837 describing
                            the death of a family of birds that nested outside their house, and
                            including a 24-line poem written by Mary's mother, Frances Few Chrystie,
                            to commemorate the birds. The notebook's main text block includes
                            journal entries from July 23, 1837 to December 24, 1837. Journal entries
                            include descriptions of daily activities, Bible texts, and other
                            lessons. Mary's mother, Frances Few Chrystie, has corrected many of
                            Mary's errors and commented on her mistakes, penmanship, and overall
                            writing style. It is clear that Mary's journals were evaluated on a
                            regular basis by her mother (see other letters and journal entries).</p>

                    <p>294 ruled pages, 221 of them with inscriptions, unpaged. Written on front
                        pastedown: numbers in a column, 2 small drawings of a house, a floorplan(?),
                        and the outline of Mary Chrystie's hand; pinned to the first page: four
                        printed stanzas beginning "And thou, my loving child..." from the poem "A
                        Mother's Thoughts Amidst her Children" by Mrs. Charles Tinsley. Above this
                        is written "Mary Chrystie / from / her / Father on / Christmas 1837". Drawn
                        on first recto of the first blank rear fol. is a detailed study of the upper
                        story and eaves of a house; on verso of second blank fol. at rear is an
                        outline of Mary's foot. Written on rear pastedown: column of dates (Monday
                        14 to Wednesday 14, followed by "How I will jump when I can say this day is
                        Wednesday 14 October 1840". Written next to S 27: "Here I am now"); a few
                        odd words; another floorplan and a few squiggles; verso of last ruled folio
                        bears what looks to be an expense ledger begun on 1 January 1839, with
                        entries for cash and candy. Mary wrote consistently in this journal up to
                        page 221 (fol. 111). Odd pages thereafter bear writing--after some blank
                        pages Mary writes "I wonder where I will be when I get here / I am now at
                        the Priory longing for home". Laid in the MS are 2 pieces of colored scrap
                        paper (greyish purple and dark pink); sewn into the pages in various
                        locations are feathers and fur belonging to Mary's pet birds, other birds,
                        and dogs. This is the journal Mary remarks upon in one of her letters as
                        having received from her father for Christmas in 1837. She wrote in it while
                        in school at Pelham Priory, 1837-1840.</p>
