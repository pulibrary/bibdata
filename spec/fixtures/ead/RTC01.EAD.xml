            <abstract>The Robert H. Taylor Collection consists of over 4,000 rare books and 3,300
                manuscripts illustrating in their wide range the scope of English literature from
                the fourteenth century to the 1940s. This finding aid focuses on the modern
                manuscripts, both bound and unbound, in the collection, which is designated "RTC01"
                within the Manuscripts Division of the Rare Books and Special Collections Department
                of the Princeton University Library. However, a brief listing of the collection's
                Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts is included.</abstract>

            <p>Robert Hill Taylor (1908-1985), Princeton University Class of 1930, amassed a
                distinguished collection of rare books, manuscripts, and drawings during more than
                50 years of active collecting. The collection began circa 1930, and was eventually
                moved to Princeton in 1960 and housed in the former Princetoniana Room in Firestone
                Library in 1972 before being moved to the high security vault in 2012. The heart of
                his collection consists of the works of Anthony Trollope (Taylor's favorite author),
                Alexander Pope, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, George Gordon Byron, and Max Beerbohm. As
                Taylor himself once stated: "I felt that these were representative authors of their
                respective periods who could still be collected with some approach to completeness,
                and so I have tried to specialize in them." <emph render="super">1</emph>
            </p>
            <p>His first gift to the Princeton University Library, made in February 1950, was the
                first edition of Daniel Defoe's The True-Born Englishman (1700). Starting in 1958,
                Taylor donated his holdings of Victorian fiction (which included numerous
                presentation copies of Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, and Charles
                Reade) to the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian Novelists (C0171), along
                with several important Anthony Trollope items from his collection. In addition,
                Taylor provided the necessary funds that enabled the Library's Department of Rare
                Books and Special Collections to purchase a variety of special items, such as the
                Tollemache Chaucer, a fifteenth-century manuscript of The Canterbury Tales.</p>
            <p>Besides his numerous and generous gifts, Taylor was an active participant in the
                Princeton University library community-giving lectures, selecting and assisting with
                Library exhibitions, and contributing scholarly articles to the <emph
                    render="italic">Princeton University Library Chronicle</emph>. In addition, he
                served as the chairman of the Council of the Friends of the Library for 26 years. In
                1975, Taylor was fittingly honored with the Donald F. Hyde Award of Princeton
                University for Distinction in Book Collection and Service to the Community of
                Scholars. He died in Princeton on May 5, 1985, but his legacy lives on through the
                distinguished and invaluable collection that bears his name and continues to
                grow.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of manuscripts, letters, and documents of numerous and
                    varied authors and artists that span nearly five centuries of English and
                    American literature. There is a variety of related material, such as such as
                    artwork, illustrated albums, letterbooks, and photographs.</p>
                <p>Authors most extensively represented include the so-called "Taylor authors"-Max
                    Beerbohm (with numerous caricatures and drawings, correspondence and
                    manuscripts), Alexander Pope, Richard Brinsley Sheridan; George Gordon Byron,
                    and Anthony Trollope.</p>
                <p>Other writers significantly represented in the collection, with regard to
                    manuscripts and/or letters, are: the Brontë family (Anne, Charlotte, and
                    Patrick), Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Benjamin Robert Haydon, Henry James,
                    George Bernard Shaw, Lytton Strachey, Alfred Tennyson, William Makepeace
                    Thackeray, the Trollope family (Frances Milton, Henry Merivale, T. Adolphus, and
                    Frances Eleanor), Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf. The major artists include
                    William Blake, Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, Edward Lear,
                    John Everett Millais, William Makepeace Thackeray, and J. M. W. Turner.</p>
                <p>Note: A listing of Taylor Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts (Series 4) is
                    included as a reference for researchers, but full textual and codicological
                    descriptions of them will eventually be published in a "Catalogue of Medieval

                <p>The Taylor modern manuscripts collection (RTC01) is housed in 23 archival boxes

                    particularly the oversized items, is stored in 17 clamshell boxes. This remains
                    an open collection, and additions continue to be made from time to time. The

                        <p>A volume of manuscript and printed material, comprising a large
                            collection of apparently unpublished verse and prose, mostly in English
                            but including sections in Latin and Greek (Oxford and Bristol, from 1716
                            to about 1740). The first half of the book consists almost entirely of
                            translations written in 1716-1717, but did not cease when Catcott moved
                            to Bristol. It is clear that most of the latter half is also from his
                            hand: this is plainly not a commonplace book, even though towards the
                            end the compositions are mostly formal academic work in Latin and Greek,
                            some of it by his pupils. A count of the volume's contents has
                            identified just over 3750 lines of English poetry (and a substantial
                            body of Latin verse too), of which the vast majority has remained
                            unpublished. Although some of the school exercises are by his pupils,
                            there is no reason to doubt that nearly all of the remainder of the
                            volume is by Catcott himself, and that it contributes a substantial body
                            of newly-identified poetry by a published early-18th century poet. 8vo
                            (binding 200 x 125mm), pp. [viii], 129, [1] blank; [2], 130-175,
                            174-233. Contemporary calf, neatly rebacked in modern times with dark
                            brown morocco, with label; edges of the leaves uncut. Spine label reads
                            "Translations / by / A. S. Catcott / Bristol /1717 / -1738." Bound in
                            (after p. 129): Catcott's "The Court of Love, A Vision from Chaucer."

                            Bristol, to F. W. Cosens, 19 June to 2 August 1884, about the volume,
                            which he borrowed for his projected "Catcott bibliography"; with one
                            letter from Cosens to George, dated 4 August 1884. Tipped in at end:

                        <p>The manuscript is a full and detailed account of Coole’s life and labours
                            in the service of God. The text is filled with transcripts of letters to
                            and from fellow Quakers, copies of his own tracts, records of meetings
                            and, inevitably, complex disputes on points of doctrine. There are also
                            records of contemporary events, such as the Great Storm of November 1703
                            (pp. 123-5), a visit by Queen Anne to Bristol (p. 120), and a petition
                            to Parliament by the Quakers in 1711 (pp. 215ff.). One loose letter
                            included within the pages has been housed in a separate enclosure.</p>

                            1854-1855, June 1879) and 3 other ALsS viz. an early ALS (Dec. 1837) to
                            Edmund's father Frederick Yates; ALS (15 May 1858) to Edmund's mother

                        <p>An anonymous, English, seventeenth-century commonplace book, written in a
                            number of hands, containing both literary and scientific entries. The
                            volume demonstrates the wide intellectual interests of the age and of
                            the milieu in which the Royal Society existed in the last two decades of
                            the seventeenth century and beyond. ‡b Topics range from religion,
                            literature, and science to carpentry, fishing and the English statute
                            law governing it. The volume would seem to date initially from the
                            period 1660-1670, but there are additions: works published in the 1680s
                            are referred to. While the bulk of the entries are in English, there are
                            some in Latin (not many), a substantial number both in Spanish and
                            translated from the Spanish, some in Italian, and some translations from
                            the French, with one text on fortification in that language
                            (ff.111r-113v). The most heavily cited Spanish source is Pedro Mexia,
                            Silva de varia leccion (1540). Often the sources are identified,
                            sometimes by date of edition, sometimes by page. Folio (310 x 200mm):
                            ff. [i], 171 (inclusive of blanks), foliated [2], 1-65, 73-84, 87,
                            92-128, 130-180, [3], with clear evidence of stubs of cancelled (cut
                            out) leaves, plus 4ff. containing indexes loosely inserted, written in
                            ink in various hands on paper watermarked with a fools cap, the index
                            leaves on a different paper (fleur-de-lys crowned). Conserved and
                            rebound in the Preservation Office, 2013. Housed in a drop-spine box
                            with the former binding, a contemporary binding of parchment over
                            pasteboard, hand-lettered on spine in ink "COMMON/ PLACE/ BOOK." The
                            boards are badly warped and lack their ties. The North Library bookplate
                            is on the inside front pastedown.</p>
                        <p>The scientific material falls into two classes, the general and
                            miscellaneous, and the more precise transcription of quite lengthy
                            passages. There are notes on a number of practical subjects such as
                            gunnery, fortification, terms in navigation, and much else. Another
                            lengthy transcription is that of Henry Sheere's (source not identified)
                            Discourse touching the current in the streight of Gibraltar, a work not
                            published until 1703, but one which circulated in manuscript from 1673,
                            the date of composition. The 47 numbered paragraphs entitled
                            "Observations and Maximes" (ff. 62r-66v), formerly misattributed to
                            Edmond Halley, is comprised of extracts from many sources and is
                            unrelated to Halley. There are also passages transcribed from Boyle's
                            Experiments and considerations touching colours of 1664 (f.1??). On
                            ff.116v=117r (127v-128r) there is a copy of Sir Jonas Moore's An
                            excellent Table for the finding of the periferies . . . of all elleipses
                            or ovals . . ., which was printed as a single sheet in [1674?] and again
                            with imprint dated 1676. However, as with the literary materials, these
                            are all jottings and no overiding aim or interest may be discerned.</p>

                        <p>Containing approximately 300 detailed receipts for cooking, medicinal
                            cures, and magic charms and formulas, in various hands. The medicinal
                            receipts include "To kill wild fire," "The great plague water," "A
                            gentle purge to be taken at any time without dainger. Good to free the
                            liver from obstructions and stoping of the cause of most diseases in
                            women..." The culinary receipts include "conserve of Cowslips," "Currant
                            Wyne," "To make flesh jelly," etc. Charms include "A writ for a madd
                            dogg" (9 words to be "written upon anything the dog will eat"). Each
                            receipt is numbered and usually gives a source attribution such as "My
                            Lady de la fountaine," "My Lady Waterman," etc. On fol. 27v there is the
                            inscription "Hear begins my Lady Sandys her receipts." Internal evidence
                            indicates that this could possibly be the wife of Sir Edwin Sandys
                            (1561-1629), the Jacobean statesman, member of the Council for Virginia
                            1607, and Treasurer of the Virginia Company 1619-20; perhaps this is his
                            4th wife Catherine (b. 1563) whom he married circa 1604 and who bore him
                            12 children. There are references in this section to "My cousen Sam
                            Sandys" [his 2nd cousin Samuel (d. 1651)?] (fol. 96r), to "Aunt Frances"
                            [his father, Edwin (1519-1585) Archbishop of York's sister?] (fol. 95r,
                            100v), "Mary Spencer" [his daughter Mary who married Richard Spencer?],
                            etc. All the receipts are fully indexed at the end (fols.
                            180v-183r).</p>

                            <p>Unpublished autograph draft of a play, in five acts, with dramatis
                                personae listing names of professional actors and a loosely inserted
                                "Prologue to the Spoken by Mr. Wilks" (2 pages). A drama set in the
                                time of Genghis Khan, here called Zingis, King of the Mongols,
                                concerning the love of Zingis for Princess Taxila, daughter of
                                Undkan, King of Eastern Tartary, who suffers the enmity of her
                                stepmother, Zamar, and the unwanted advances of Zamar's son, Prince
                                Timur. The story appears to have been adopted from <emph
                                    render="italic">Zingis: Histoire Tartare</emph> by Anne de la
                                Roche-Guilhem (1691). The actors' names include Mr. Mills, Sr. and
                                Jr., presumably John (d. 1736) and William (fl. 1701-50) Mills, and
                                Mr. and Mrs. Booth, possibly Barton (1679?-1733) and Hester
                                (ca.1690-1773) Booth. These actors all worked at Drury Lane.</p>

                        <p>This scribal copy is of key satires of the 1660s, now usually attributed
                            to poet Andrew Marvell. The Second and Third Advice poems, written in
                            imitation of Edmund Waller's "Instructions to a Painter" (1664), take as
                            their subject the conduct of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, especially that
                            of the Royal Navy with the Duke of York as Lord High Admiral. Both poems
                            circulated initially in manuscript: some fifty manuscript copies of the
                            Second Advice are known, and thirty-three copies of the Third. Many

                            Masefield's early book on Shakespeare that was first published in 1911
                            and revised in 1954. This version was clearly designed for the stage and
                            was made (or possibly only for) Alec Clunes, one of the leading English
                            actors of the post-war years. The title page states that it is his
                            property (c/o the Arts Theatre Club in London). Loosely inserted are
                            several copies of a program for performances at the Hague and Amsterdam

                        <p>An intimate and detailed autobiography of a wealthy Puritan gentry woman,
                            Mary Whitelocke, the daughter of London merchant Bigley Carleton, in the
                            mid-seventeenth century. Addressed to her eldest son, Whitelocke's
                            memoir encompasses her life from the time of her first marriage at the
                            age of 16 to Rowland Wilson (d. 1650), MP, also from a London mercantile
                            family. Whitelocke's second marriage in 1650 was to the prominent lawyer
                            and politician Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605-1675), with whom she had seven
                            children. Written in a homiletic style with copious Biblical references
                            in the margins, the memoir is characterised by distinctively feminine
                            imagery: "...god deals with his people as a tender harted mother dus
                            with her child at her breast, she puts some bitter thing upon the nipple
                            not to hurt the child but to make the child care the less for the
                            breast: so the lord dealt with me he put some bitter dispensation upon
                            all my creature injoyments..." and primarily focuses on Whitelocke's
                            family and domestic affairs, much of it given over to her children and
                            their loving and pious behavior; she gives a poignant account of a
                            miscarriage that occurred during her first marriage. Though, discussion
                            of public affairs and events are also included, particularly
                            Whitelocke's vigorous defence of her second husband's public life.</p>

                        <p>These very personal letters from Florence to her close friend span a
                            lengthy period and document pivotal events in Hardy's life, specifically
                            those relating to her relationship with Thomas Hardy. These include the
                            death of Thomas Hardy's first wife, Emma; Florence's marriage to Thomas
                            in 1914; and Thomas' death in 1928.</p>
                        <p>Many of the letters concern Florence and her husband's personal lives as
                            well as Thomas Hardy's writings and professional endeavors. Some also
                            include discussion of current events, specifically World War I, due to
                            the death of Thomas' cousin whom he had selected as his heir. A few
                            photo postcards are also included, such as one that depicts Florence,
                            Thomas, the Pococks, and other friends enjoying a picnic (May 7,
                            1918).</p>
