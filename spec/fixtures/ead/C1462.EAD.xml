                    <p>This series consists of approximately one hundred and forty family letters, comprising some 450 pages, written on tours of Europe and the Middle East around 1840, several nicely illustrated. Includes a copius run of retained drafts of letters to Isaac Taylor, the publishers Houlston and Wright, Dr. Robert Trail, the painter Josiah Gilbert, and others, concerning publication of plates after drawings made on his tours. The present letters - many of which, written on large extended sheets of paper, are very long - display the élan of a young Englishman on the Grand Tour and provide the reader with a vivid view of Middle Eastern travel in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
