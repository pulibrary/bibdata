# Languages indexed by bibdata

## Language codes

There are several standards for representing human languages.  Bibdata concerns itself with the language codes from the following standards:
* IANA Language Subtag Registry
* MARC codes for languages (which is largely the same as ISO 639-2)
* ISO 639-3
* ISO 639-5 (collective language codes)

These standards have various levels of overlap, as discussed in the following table:

## Language codes in MARC records

MARC codes and ISO 639-3 codes may be found in MARC records, as described in the following table.  IANA codes are not in MARC records, so we compute those ourselves.

<!-- Using HTML in this table to add row headers and a caption, which are not included in Github-flavored markdown -->
<table aria-label="Language codes included in MARC records">
    <caption>Language codes included in MARC records</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Type of language code</th>
            <th scope="col">Used in 008 field</th>
            <th scope="col">Used in 041 field</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">MARC</th>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">ISO 639-3</th>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Yes, but needs 2nd indicator=<code>7</code> and <code>$2iso639-3</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Solr fields

Language data is stored in the following solr fields.  In general, the `language_facet` field will contain the most languages, to provide patrons with additional access points.  The `language_name_display` is intended for the show page, where we instead want to display only the most specific language information we have.

<!-- Using HTML in this table to add row headers and a caption, which are not included in Github-flavored markdown -->
<table aria-label="Language-related Solr fields">
    <caption>Language-related Solr fields</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Solr field</th>
            <th scope="col">Where in the catalog is it used?</th>
            <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>language_facet</code></th>
            <td>Facets</td>
            <td>Provide many relevant language access points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>language_name_display</code></th>
            <td>Show page (pending)</td>
            <td>Show only the most specific language information</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>language_iana_s</code></th>
            <td>Show page (not displayed to user), JSON-LD</td>
            <td>Inform screen readers which language pack to use when reading catalog record</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>language_display</code></th>
            <td>Show page</td>
            <td>Additional notes about the languages provided by catalogers (MARC 546 field)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### Decision tree

    accDescr {
        Language codes are taken from the 008 and 041 fields of a MARC
        record.  All language codes are indexed for the facets, regardless
        of their source.  Before indexing a code for use in the show page,
        however, there are two checks.  First, we confirm that it is not
        a macrolanguage of another code in the record.  Second, we confirm
        that if we are looking at a MARC code in a 041 field, that there
        aren't ISO 639-3 codes available instead.  If neither of these
        checks exclude the language code, we index it for the show page.
    }
    subgraph MARC record
        008[Language code in 008]
        041[Language code in 041]
    end
    008 --> macrolanguage{Is it the macrolanguage of another code in the record?}
    041 --> ISO{Is it an ISO 639-3 code?}
    macrolanguage-->|Yes| facet
    macrolanguage-->|No| show
    ISO-->|Yes| show
    show --> facet
