# Theses

- Any theses that have a `pu.date.classyear` of 2012 or earlier should have a holding.

- `restriction note`: The item is restricted by IP address. The user views it online at dedicated computers in the library.

- Theses from 2013 and later should not have a `pu.location` field. Some from 2013 and later have an `access restriction` that is expressed like this:
`dc.rights.accessRightsWalk`-in Access. This thesis can only be viewed on computer terminals at the `<a href=http://mudd.princeton.edu>Mudd Manuscript Library</a>`.

- We transitioned to Born Digital Theses in 2013. Those should only have an `Available Online` link to DataSpace, and no holdings record. Patrons go directly to DataSpace to access the content for those.

- Theses from 2012 and earlier have physical copies and should have a holdings record. Patrons need to request them through the catalog. 

- Embargoed items can have a holdings record as long as the holding disappears when the embargo expires.
