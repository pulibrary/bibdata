1.  Look in the scratch directory specified on the [events page](https://bibdata.princeton.edu/events) for the directory name <dir_name>
1. `ls -ltr <dir-name>` to determine if all the files that are present are from the same date (the time does not matter) as the bibdata event error.
   1. If there are no other files
      `rm /data/marc_liberation_files/partner_update_scratch/*.*`

      We have no idea what to do here
1. On the [events page](https://bibdata.princeton.edu/events) Login and delete the failed event ( You may have to scroll to the right to see the delete button)
   1. If the event error exists they may not reindex
