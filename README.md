## Development and testing

### Dependencies
  * Postgresql (provided in development by lando)
  * `brew install lastpass-cli`
  * `brew install shared-mime-info` (for `mimemagic` gem)

Note: You need to have PostgreSQL installed in your machine and available in your path for the `pg` gem to compile native extensions (e.g. `export PATH=$PATH:/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin/`).

### Setup server
1. Install Lando from https://github.com/lando/lando/releases (at least 3.0.0-rrc.2)
1. Install Sidekiq Pro credentials:
```
lpass login emailhere
bin/setup_keys
```
1. Install bundler version in Gemfile.lock
```
gem install bundler -v '2.2.27'
```
1. Install bundle
```
bundle install
```
1. To start: `bundle exec rake servers:start`
1. For testing:
   - `bundle exec rspec`
1. For development:
   - `bundle exec rails server`
   - Access bibdata at http://localhost:3000/
1. If you are working with background jobs in development, start sidekiq in a new tab or window
   - `bundle exec sidekiq`
   - To access the sidekiq dashboard, first sign into the application, then go to http://localhost:3000/sidekiq
1. To stop: `bundle exec rake servers:stop` or `lando stop`

## Configure Alma keys for Development

1. `lpass login emailhere`
1. `bundle exec rake alma:setup_keys`

This will add a .env with credentials to Rails.root

## ARK Caching

In order to resolve bibliographic identifiers (bib. IDs) to resources with ARKs and IIIF manifests for resources managed within digital repositories, caches are seeded and used in order to resolve the relationships between these resources.

### Seeding the Cache

One may seed the cache using the following Rake Task:
```bash
rake liberate:arks:seed_cache
```

In development, when running commands that utilize the cache, such as commands indexing via traject, set the `FIGGY_ARK_CACHE_PATH` to point to `spec/fixtures/marc_to_solr/figgy_ark_cache` in the local environment.
```bash
export FIGGY_ARK_CACHE_PATH=spec/fixtures/marc_to_solr/figgy_ark_cache
```

### Clearing the Cache

One may clear the cache using the following Rake Task:
```bash
rake liberate:arks:clear_cache
```


## Tests

Ensure redis is running

To run the tests in the `marc_to_solr` directory set RAILS_ENV:
`$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec marc_to_solr/spec`

To run all the tests use the rake task, which sets some environment variables for you:
`$ rake spec`

## Deploy
Deployment is through capistrano. To deploy a branch other than "main", prepend an environment variable to your deploy command, e.g.:
`BRANCH=my_feature bundle exec cap staging deploy`
